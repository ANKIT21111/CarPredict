## Workflow  

### 1. **Data Acquisition**  
- Data loaded into the `bpd` dataframe.  
- Column headers were added based on index numbers.  
- Dataset saved as CSV for future use.  

---

### 2. **Data Understanding**  
- Explored features and their data types.  
- Generated statistical summaries using `describe(include="all")`.  
- Used `info()` to inspect non-null values and data types.  

---

### 3. **Data Wrangling**  
Identified and handled missing data:  
1. **Identify missing data**.  
2. **Handle missing data**.  
3. **Correct data format**.  

---

### 4. **Data Transformation**  
- Converted quantitative features to appropriate metrics using mathematical techniques.  

---

### 5. **Data Normalization**  
- Normalized numerical features.  
- Used binning for categorizing numerical variables.  
- Applied **one-hot encoding** to convert categorical variables into numerical ones.  

---

### 6. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- **Continuous Numerical Variables Analysis**: Regression plots to assess linear relationships.  
- **Categorical Variables Analysis**: Used box plots, `value_counts`, grouping, and pivot tables.  
- **Descriptive Statistical Analysis**: Heatmaps, correlation, causation, and ANOVA analysis.  

---

### 7. **Feature Selection**  
Key variables for price prediction:  
- **Continuous Numerical Variables**: Length, Width, Curb-weight, Engine-size, Horsepower, City-mpg, Highway-mpg, Wheel-base, Bore.  
- **Categorical Variables**: Drive-wheels.  

---

### 8. **Model Development**  
1. **Simple Linear Regression**: One independent variable.  
2. **Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)**: Multiple independent variables.  
3. **Polynomial Regression**: Non-linear relationships handled via polynomial transformations.  
4. **Pipelines**: Simplified data preprocessing and scaling using `Pipeline` and `StandardScaler`.  

---

### 9. **Model Evaluation**  
- Used regression and residual plots for model visualization.  
- Evaluated models using **R¬≤** and **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** metrics.  

**Performance Metrics**:  
- **Simple Linear Regression**:  
  - R¬≤: 0.6418  
  - MSE: 2.25 x 10‚Å∑  
- **Multiple Linear Regression**:  
  - R¬≤: 0.8119  
  - MSE: 1.2 x 10‚Å∑  
- **Polynomial Regression**:  
  - R¬≤: 0.6754  
  - MSE: 2.04 x 10‚Å∑  

**Conclusion**: MLR provided the best results due to its ability to account for multiple variables.

### 10. **Model Predictions**  
- Predicted outcomes for the test dataset using regression models.  
- Compared **training** and **testing** R¬≤ scores.  
- Applied `cross_val_score` to address limited test data issues.  

---

### 11. **Model Refinement**  
- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Polynomial Features  
  - Ridge Regression  
  - Hyperparameter Tuning (using `alpha` variable and Grid Search).  

- **Optimized Result**: Achieved an R¬≤ score of **0.84** for the test dataset after optimization.

## Key Insights  
Through the systematic application of machine learning models and evaluation techniques, we identified that the **Multiple Linear Regression model** offers the best predictive power for car price estimation. The use of model refinement and hyperparameter tuning further improved prediction accuracy.
